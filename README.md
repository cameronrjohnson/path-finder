# Overview
Various Pathfinding Algorithms.

The purpose of this program is to be able to find the shortest path between two points on a grid system. This program demonstrates the various different ways to do this using six different algorithms. This program is also made to prove a proficiency in using the Java Language.

# Development Environment

To use this program first you will want to select the desired Pathfinding algorithm in the top right. Next, you will want to generate your desired maze and hit start. After all this you can iterate to the next step of the algorith with the iterate button or set it on auto. All the logic inside this project was made in Java with the GUI using Swing.
